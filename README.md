# Glassmorphism is pretty rad ðŸ”Ž ðŸ’³ 

Here's a photorealistic card concept that's getting really popular in design. For the texture I used that fuzzy tv noise and reduced it's opacity with overlay.


### Looking forward to when this isn't so hard to translate to code ðŸ’» ðŸ˜… (Here are the limitations of this design)
- backdrop-filter probably need more support to play nice with more browsers
- the orginal design tried to mirror real life reflects but this requires gradient border
- Save yourself some heart ache and just use a png or svg of the darn thing!
